**Project Nessie** is an open-source data lake catalog and version control system. It provides Git-like semantics (branches, tags, commits) for data lakes, allowing you to manage, track, and isolate changes to your data over time.

### Key Features:
- **Data Versioning:** Track changes to tables, schemas, and data in your data lake.
- **Branching & Tagging:** Create isolated branches for experimentation or development, and tag important versions.
- **Atomic Operations:** Ensure consistent and reliable data operations.
- **Integration:** Works with Apache Iceberg, Delta Lake, Apache Spark, Trino, Presto, and other data lake technologies.

### Use Cases:
- Safe experimentation with data without affecting production.
- Rollback to previous data states.
- Collaborative data engineering workflows.

### Example Usage:
You can use Nessie via its REST API, CLI, or integrations with supported engines. For example, with Apache Iceberg:

````bash
spark-shell --conf spark.sql.catalog.nessie.uri=http://localhost:19120/api/v1
````

- **Concurrency:** Built to handle thousands of concurrent users and queries, making it suitable for enterprise-scale analytics.
- **Integration:** Powers Databricks SQL endpoints and BI dashboards, enabling interactive analytics and reporting.

**Note:** Polaris is not a standalone open-source project; it is a core component of the Databricks platform, available to Databricks customers.

For more details, see the [Databricks documentation](https://docs.databricks.com/en/sql/index.html) or recent Databricks announcements.

**LakeFS** is an open-source data version control system for object storage-based data lakes (such as Amazon S3, Google Cloud Storage, or Azure Blob Storage). It brings Git-like operations—such as branching, committing, and merging—to data lakes, enabling safe experimentation, reproducibility, and collaboration on large datasets.

---

### Key Features

- **Git-like Versioning:** Create branches, commit changes, and merge data just like with source code.
- **Atomic Operations:** Make changes to large datasets atomically, reducing risk of partial updates.
- **Isolation:** Experiment with data in isolated branches without affecting production data.
- **Reproducibility:** Easily reproduce data states for debugging, auditing, or machine learning experiments.
- **Integration:** Works with Spark, Presto, Trino, Hive, and other data processing engines.

---

### Example Workflow

1. **Create a Branch:**  
   Create a new branch for experimentation.
2. **Process Data:**  
   Run ETL or ML jobs on the branch.
3. **Commit Changes:**  
   Commit the results to the branch.
4. **Merge:**  
   Merge the branch into main when ready.

---

### Example CLI Commands

````bash
lakefs branch create experiment main
lakefs commit experiment --message "Processed new data"
lakefs merge experiment main
````
